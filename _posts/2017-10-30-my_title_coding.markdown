Disclaimer: This is my first blog ever, I apoligize in advance for any typos or grammatical errors. With that out of the way I should introduce myself. My name is Adam and I enjoy spending time with friends and family like most people. I grew up on Legos, K'NEX, origami and a bunch of other things. I have always liked creating things. And now with some nephews who live close by I can get in more Lego time.

I love how modular Legos and K'NEX are. I didn't realize it then but now it seems pretty obvious to most people that modularity is one of their most defining features. I like that coding is also very modular (at least when done right it is).

My first Computer Science course I ever took was initially on a whim. But it was enough to set the hook. So I decided to take more CS courses. I used C++ and Java for those classes. Learning Ruby has been easier because of familiarity with the other programming languages I previously learned. While the beginning classes were pretty straight forward I realized that the more advanced classes were going at a much faster pace in a format that was difficult for me to keep up with. So I figured I could learn coding better in an online/go-at-your-own-pace format which lead me to FlatIron.

I believe coding is a skill, and like all skills, takes time and effort to refine. Practicing skills is satisfying and using your developed skills for something useful is even more satisfying. With these concepts in mind it's easy to see how important it will be for me, or anyone else for that matter, to keep learning coding skills. I'd like to conclude with a quote from Napolean Dynamite, "Girls only want boyfirends who have great skills."
