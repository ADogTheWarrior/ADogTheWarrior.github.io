I mainly picked the idea because it was the first idea I had that met the requirements. The most important part in deciding was having the database set up correctly with user, book, and author models. Has a user that owns a book shelf which is just books associated with a user. Since there are multiple users and multiple books it's a many to many relationship. Obviously each book has an author and thats just a many to one relationship.

So I started working on the app a while ago. I had some difficulties getting it done. I fell into a slump but I managed to get out of it. My suggestion is don't take a break from the course, just power through the best you can. It's much easier to maintain momentum than to lose it and build it up again. One of the most annoying things I dealt with was having to go back through lessons to relearn what I needed for the project.

I like the idea of pulling on a thread. If I had something I was struggling with or didn't understand I'd pull on that thread trying to find what I didn't understand. I basically kept on asking what I need until I gpt to something that was simple to do. For example I was frustrated with the log in feature. So I pulled on the thread to see what was frustrating about the feature. I realized I didn't know how to use omniauth. So I pulled on the thread further and realized I needed to learn more about omniauth. So then I got to a point were I knew what needed to be done, learn about omniauth. But I pulled the thread further and saw I could approach it two ways. First ask for help or look for information and tutorials online. I ended up looking up tutorials first and then I emailed for help when I couldn't find what I needed.

It sucks to be embarrassed about not finishing in a timely manner but I think it is worse to not finish at all. I'm glad I got back on my feet and got this done. Moving forward I'm gonna look at the specs for the next project. Then as I go through the lesson I will take notes on things that are hard or might be relevant for the project. So when I get to the next project I will be able to get it done much more quickly.
